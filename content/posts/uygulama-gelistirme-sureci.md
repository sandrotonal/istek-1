# Application Development Process

A successful application requires a disciplined development process.

## 1. Idea and Research

- Creating user personas

## 2. Planning

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

```
Feature Prioritization:
P0 - Critical (MVP)
P1 - Important (First Release)
P2 - Nice to Have (Future Releases)
```

### Technical Planning

- Technology stack selection
- Architecture decisions
- Database design
- API endpoint planning

## 3. Design

- Wireframing
- UI/UX design
- Prototype creation
- User testing

## 4. Development

### Agile Sprints

```
Sprint 1 (2 weeks):
- User authentication
- Dashboard creation
- Basic CRUD operations

Sprint 2 (2 weeks):
- Advanced features
- Integrations
- UI polish
```

## 5. Testing

- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- E2E testing
- User acceptance testing

## 6. Deployment

### CI/CD Pipeline

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: |
          npm ci
          npm run build
          npm run deploy
```

## 7. Monitoring and Maintenance

- Error tracking (Sentry)
- Analytics (Google Analytics)
- Performance monitoring
- Regular updates

## Conclusion

Successful applications emerge through a well-planned and iterative process.
